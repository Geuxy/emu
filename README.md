# Emu Anti-Cheat
### This anti-cheat was developed for education purposes so it is not recommended for actual use.
For the Legacy versions of Minecraft (1.7-1.8), Emu is an anti-cheat plugin for Spigot that makes use of the PacketEvents 2.2.0 packet processing library.

This anticheat was mostly inspired by and somewhat based on AntiHaxerman anticheat (https://github.com/Tecnio/antihaxerman), It was the reason i thought
it would be fun to make an anticheat and learn how they work better.
